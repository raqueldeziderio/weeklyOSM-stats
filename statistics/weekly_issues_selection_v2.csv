According to official, but controversial information, the hurricane killed 64 people.

The researchers selected around 100 out of the 900 [barrios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrios_of_Puerto_Rico) in Puerto Rico, which are small administrative units with an average of less than 5000 inhabitants. For the sample of households, the authors randomly identified 35 buildings from the buildings on an OSM map in each of the approximately 100 barrios. The data for the selected buildings were downloaded from the Overpass API, the centroids were calculated  and converted into [Geospatial PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospatial_PDF) files. The  files along with an OSM base map were copied to the Samsung Tab A 7 tablets of the on-site interviewer.

Based on the surveyed households' data, researchers estimate that 62% or 4,645 more people died in the post-hurricane period than in the same period in the previous year.

Mateusz Konieczny, leader of the  'OSM World' moderators team on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4smYkq3gzp) (account needed) noted that the nine moderators from around the world have taken this complaint seriously. However, after hours of searching through the logs for the abusive comments described by Bert they were unable to find them. They reminded users that anyone on the discussion groups can contact the moderators directly (message @ModMail) to report abusive, racist, or insulting language. 

  Our [statement](https://weeklyosm.eu/archives/14381#wn556_24609) that there is a radio amateur on the current OSMF board is not correct. While we have learnt that one can find amateur radio operators actively contributing to the Overpass API, helping in the OSMF MWG, as founders of projects such as OpenRailwayMap, and in many other roles, we also learnt that there isn't one on the OSMF board.

His idea is that the number of POIs over time should develop similarly to [Species Accumulation Curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_discovery_curve)  (at first increasing slowly but then accelerating and finally leveling off ). The article details step by step his approach of investigating the question for shops in the UK using Overpass, Osmium and PostgreSQL. He concluded that there are still a lot of shops to be added, even in the best-mapped places. Some shop types, `shop=supermarket` and `shop=doityourself`, do show signs of slowdown. In terms of the number of distinct values for`shop=` he found the curve tailed off and suggests that the existing shop tags are sufficient to meet our tagging needs.

All changes can be found there.

The most obvious change, as the OSM Ops team [tweeted](https://twitter.com/OSM_Tech/status/1613681130829406209), is the representation of unpaved roads.  Unpaved roads will be rendered with a subtle stipple effect to show them as being not paved. The OSM Ops Team says: 'Unpaved roads with a suitable tag will be styled differently. Change background: [https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/pull/3399](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/pull/3399)'.

The Ops team goes on to say 'this unfortunately leaves a dilemma, many regions in OpenStreetMap unpaved is the presumed default in the absence of a `surface=` tag. But! We can fix this, let us map if roads are `surface=paved` or `surface=unpaved` (or more specific types)'.

The OSM Ops Team then turned to three organisations with a friendly appeal for help: 'Germany already has 46% of roads surfaces mapped. Zimbabwe it is only 14%. So let us get mapping road surfaces! How about it? @hotosm  @osmafrica  @youthmappers'.

A sample from the 12 cities that have started participating in the Open Cities Africa project was used.  He found out that on average 27.8% of buildings in the sample have an irregular geometry and 5.6% have overlaps or are an invalid polygon. However, there are important variations and some peaks with Pointe-Noire having over 24% of buildings with overlapping ways or invalid polygons and Victoria with more than 72% of all buildings with irregular, i.e. non-rectangular, form.

Various explanations are proposed such as the lack of good imagery for the area, dense urban areas, mapathons with inexperienced contributors and low number of local contributors.",6,714

There were many new mappers, that never did any other mapping besides the mapping party in which they participated. The verification of this data is a huge job. Pierre's approach is to find objects without primary key (such as building, highway, etc) or where the value is clearly a note (such as highway=I'm not sure whether there is a road here). He tried some analysis with his own tools on a planet dumb of Nepal. With some help from the community he finds the JOSM plugins OSMantic and OSMRecPlugin. The second one seems promising for his needs. Also there are some disabled tests from Osmose that might help.

Pierre's approach is to find objects without primary key (such as building, highway, etc) or where the value is clearly a note (such as highway=I'm not sure whether there is a road here). He tried some analysis with his own tools on a planet dumb of Nepal. With some help from the community he finds the JOSM plugins OSMantic and OSMRecPlugin.

UN Mappers opened a [poll](https://twitter.com/UN_Mappers/status/1460925031098339334), during GISDay, to explore the reasons and to propose free training sessions on this powerful editor.

The plan is to update all `mapillary` tags from the old 22-character form to the new  numeric IDs of version 4. The Wiki page will be used to track current statistics and any further plan of action.

There was also a [MapRoulette challenge](https://maproulette.org/browse/challenges/23278) that sought to clean up all the invalid values, but it is now complete.",7,1768

They involve collaboration between a challenge owner, providing the proposed OSM changes, and you, validating, tweaking and committing them to OSM.

17624,"WN664","Software","[Achim Domma](https://twitter.com/achimdomma) has pointed out a tweet by [Katharina Nocum](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharina_Nocun). In this tweet, the publicist and net activist [complains](https://twitter.com/kattascha/status/1537511718095659008) that pedestrian routing wants to route her through an unlit park at 3 am. Manfred Reiter takes up the problem (in Mastodon) and [refers to](https://social.saarland/@derFred/110163786522921477) possibilities of improving the data through [Mapathons](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapathon), organised mapping like the UK [quarterly project](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/UK_Quarterly_Project/2023/2023_Q1_Project:_Fixmes_and_Notes), or [MapRoulette](https://www.maproulette.org/). He directly addresses the publishers of [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) and [Graphhopper](https://www.graphhopper.com/open-source/). It will be interesting to see which app tackles this problem first, or whether [Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app/) will come out on top.",7,1811

Analysis in an associated [blog post](http://k1z.blog.uni-heidelberg.de/2021/02/04/the-evolution-of-humanitarian-mapping-within-the-openstreetmap-community/) lets us see the progression in the number of contributors since 2012 followed by a decline since 2017. No breakdown of contributors by experience (i.e. days of contribution, objects edited, etc.) is given. The author notes that to associate all these tasks with humanitarian mapping (or all humanitarian mapping with only these tasks) is therefore an oversimplified definition and the results must be taken with a grain of salt.",7,2044

UK contributors were not consulted prior to these actions and some contributors are upset by the  lack of communication and transparency,  and poor mapping quality, such as retagging residential roads as motorways ([example](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/102440180)) ([see discussion](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-gb/2021-April/026664.html)).

This has been achieved through upgraded hardware and updated versions of osm2pgsql, GEOS, PostgreSQL and PostGIS, increasing processing throughput by 10 times compared to 2024. These hourly updates are reflected in Thunderforest's APIs for vector sources, styles, and map tiles, increasing mapper motivation through faster map updates. While further reducing the update frequency to 10 to 20 minutes is feasible, internal caching limits the visible benefits, so hourly updates are considered sufficient for now.",8,2430

The OSM Operations Team (one permanent and volunteers) reported on the OSM Community forum about the progress to get back online.
  The ISP had confirmed the issue and was waiting for a replacement router shipped from California to the Amsterdam site.
  OSM's infrastructure includes a primary database in Amsterdam and follower databases in Dublin, synchronised through asynchronous replication. The uplink failure in Amsterdam led to a minor amount of map data being unsynced with Dublin. To avoid data loss, the Dublin database was not promoted to the primary role. Manual synchronisation over a 4G VPN was also deemed too risky, so as a precaution, OSM was placed in read-only mode to maintain data integrity.
  In the meantime, the OSM operations were successful in moving to a new ISP for deployment in Amsterdam and Dublin, while awaiting the expedited delivery and installation of the replacement router.
  On Tuesday 17 December, around 13:24:48 UTC, all services were back up and [running](https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/openstreetmap-org-currently-offline-operations-team-are-working-to-restore-15-december-2024-updated/122930/81) again.

Allan Mustard, the new elected member of the OSMF board, seems to [support](https://twitter.com/allan_mustard/status/1214184015940476929?s=20) this position. Brian Housel from Mapbox [argues](https://twitter.com/bhousel/status/1214187417961402368?s=20) that the i, which only opens the OSM attribution after a mouse over, is sufficient.

  We [reported](https://weeklyosm.eu/archives/14381#wn556_24600) Bert -Araali- Van Opstal's complaint about some behaviour on Discord. Mateusz Konieczny, leader of the  'OSM World' moderators team on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4smYkq3gzp) (account needed) noted that the nine moderators from around the world have taken this complaint seriously. However, after hours of searching through the logs for the abusive comments described by Bert they were unable to find them. They reminded users that anyone on the discussion groups can contact the moderators directly (message @ModMail) to report abusive, racist, or insulting language. 

  Our [statement](https://weeklyosm.eu/archives/14381#wn556_24609) that there is a radio amateur on the current OSMF board is not correct. While we have learnt that one can find amateur radio operators actively contributing to the Overpass API, helping in the OSMF MWG, as founders of projects such as OpenRailwayMap, and in many other roles, we also learnt that there isn't one on the OSMF board.

As the weeklyOSM volunteer writers and editors cannot systematically go through all discussion and forum threads or social media posts, it is up to you to follow the links, read further, form your own opinions, and participate in the discussions.

19665,"WN718","Releases","GraphHopper version 9.0 has been [released](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2024/04/23/graphhopper-routing-engine-9-0-released/). It comes with an improved GPX export, updated translations, many bug fixes, more route hints, and conditional access information.",12,4077
20159,"WN730","Releases","GraphHopper has [introduced](https://chaos.social/@karussell/112734598199995625) a user-friendly update to its mapping service, 'Route Planning Step-by-Step', which allows walkers and cyclists to easily create and modify routes by right-clicking or long-pressing on the map to set start and end points and add additional locations. This update [improved](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2024/07/05/route-planning-step-by-step/) route customisation directly on desktop and mobile devices, making the planning process more intuitive and flexible.",12,4078
20830,"WN746","Releases","Peter [announced](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2024/11/05/graphhopper-routing-engine-10-0-released/) the release of GraphHopper Routing Engine version 10.0. This release fixed a long-standing issue with u-turn routing, added several improvements to turn restriction implementations, and included an enhanced version of GraphHopper Maps with text search functionality.",12,4079
21312,"WN756","Programming","Swiggy Bytes’s two-part blog series explored leveraging OpenStreetMap data for hyperlocal delivery routing by evaluating road quality and using machine learning to detect and fix issues. [Part 1](https://bytes.swiggy.com/the-osm-distance-service-part-1-evaluation-metrics-and-routing-configurations-6e8686ca814f) introduced the OSM-APLS and delta-coverage metrics to evaluate OSM's road accuracy. By analysing delivery trips, they identified routing configurations, concluding that the 'motorcycle short-fastest' mode was optimal for accurate distance calculations using GraphHopper. [Part 2](https://bytes.swiggy.com/the-osm-distance-service-part-2-fixing-roads-90bd6d3bb60f) presented a machine learning pipeline to detect missing roads, connectivity issues, and incorrect travel directions in OSM. Using unsupervised and self-supervised approaches, the system flagged and fixed errors, improving coverage and accuracy of road networks.",12,4080

14321,"WN569","Software","This week Mapillary announced various changes to their service which include but are not limited to changes in the login process: Google, Facebook and OSM logins are going to be discontinued in favour of e-mail logins and a few website features such as the sequence editor (aside from blur editing) and web uploader will no longer be available. Android users will be required to download a [new app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapillary.app) for capturing images. On the upside, Mapillary is going to offer photo filtering based on their age, 3D scenes will be available to browse for all, and a new API has been [introduced](https://www.mapillary.com/developer/api-documentation).

The plan is to update all `mapillary` tags from the old 22-character form to the new  numeric IDs of version 4. The Wiki page will be used to track current statistics and any further plan of action.

21281,"WN756","Other Geo Things","Christopher Beddow has [looked](https://worldbuilder.substack.com/p/street-view-a-history) at how street-level imagery has changed over time. He started by investigating the early 20th century with city recordings and goes on to discuss Google Street View and similar services today. He talked about important moments including the Aspen Movie Map (1978), early road surveys, and the CityBlock project at Stanford. This project was the first step in creating street view and similar services. Now there are other options such as  Mapillary and Panoramax, which use open-source and crowdsourcing methods. With new developments in computer vision and LiDAR, we can expect even more realistic 3D maps and experiences that we may be able to view on more than just our phones and computers.",13,4867
