21308,"WN756","Software","Andy Allan [tooted](https://m.gravitystorm.co.uk/@gravitystorm/113781309911289047) that the Thunderforest\.com vector tile generation servers now process OpenStreetMap data updates every 60 minutes, a significant improvement on the previous four-hour cycle. This has been achieved through upgraded hardware and updated versions of osm2pgsql, GEOS, PostgreSQL and PostGIS, increasing processing throughput by 10 times compared to 2024. These hourly updates are reflected in Thunderforest's APIs for vector sources, styles, and map tiles, increasing mapper motivation through faster map updates. While further reducing the update frequency to 10 to 20 minutes is feasible, internal caching limits the visible benefits, so hourly updates are considered sufficient for now.",8
