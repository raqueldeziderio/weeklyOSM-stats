The Russian OSM blog [reports about it](http://shtosm.ru/all/otkrytie-goda/). MAPS.ME is an offline map application based on Qt5 framwork for Android, iOS, Windows, Mac and Linux. Teams of Wochennotiz and weeklyOSM are looking for someone who wants to blog at our blog about a hands-on of MAPS.ME and comparison with other OSM-bases offline map applications. Some users at the OsmAnd Google Group [think](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/osmand/7MAbPRjoNmk) that the rendering engine of MAPS.ME is superior to the OsmAnd rendering engine."
"64","WN272","Software","Apparently, most OsmAnd maps are updated only once a month instead of as hitherto approximately three times per month. Torsten Bronger [supposed it](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/osmand/pOgl0NMVjI0) in OsmAnd-Google Group.
