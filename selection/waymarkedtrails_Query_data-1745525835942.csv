It helps monitor super-route and route relations and offers fruitful documentation on hiking trails using OSM tags, including network, reference, level of difficulty (`sac_scale`), trail symbols (`osmc:symbol`) and elevation profiles. The OSM hierarchy of routes and super-routes allows the presentation of elevation profiles and downloading trails at various level of detail in kml and gpx formats. See the other sports [covered](https://waymarkedtrails.org/) by Waymarked Trails on their website."
