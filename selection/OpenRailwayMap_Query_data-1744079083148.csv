Rails is a web framework that powers, amongst others, the OpenStreetMap.org website.

13865,"WN557","About us","We have received two comments regarding issue #556. Here are some clarifications on these subjects: 

  We [reported](https://weeklyosm.eu/archives/14381#wn556_24600) Bert -Araali- Van Opstal's complaint about some behaviour on Discord. Mateusz Konieczny, leader of the  'OSM World' moderators team on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4smYkq3gzp) (account needed) noted that the nine moderators from around the world have taken this complaint seriously. However, after hours of searching through the logs for the abusive comments described by Bert they were unable to find them. They reminded users that anyone on the discussion groups can contact the moderators directly (message @ModMail) to report abusive, racist, or insulting language. 

  Our [statement](https://weeklyosm.eu/archives/14381#wn556_24609) that there is a radio amateur on the current OSMF board is not correct. While we have learnt that one can find amateur radio operators actively contributing to the Overpass API, helping in the OSMF MWG, as founders of projects such as OpenRailwayMap, and in many other roles, we also learnt that there isn't one on the OSMF board.

As the weeklyOSM volunteer writers and editors cannot systematically go through all discussion and forum threads or social media posts, it is up to you to follow the links, read further, form your own opinions, and participate in the discussions. You can also reach us easily if you would like report and contribute to brief summaries of discussions to contribute to a better weeklyOSM.

Let's have fun and maintain a respectful and enjoyable environment!"
