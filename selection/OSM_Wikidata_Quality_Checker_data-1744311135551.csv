The application checks existing links from OpenStreetMap to Wikidata. The errors found &ndash; for example invalid Wikidata entries in OpenStreetMap &ndash; are also sent to Osmose-QA with a suggested correction. The software processes the data worldwide on a weekly basis. Currently, a total of over 30,000 error notes have been found in nine categories. They are now looking for a place to host this data processing pipeline permanently."
