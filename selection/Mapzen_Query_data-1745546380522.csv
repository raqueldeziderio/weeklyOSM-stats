4846,"WN363","OSM in action","Mapzen [presents](https://mapzen.com/blog/osmlr-2nd-technical-preview/) a second technical preview of OSMLR. It ""provides a stable linear-referencing system atop the ever-changing network of roadways in OpenStreetMap. It’s used by the Open Traffic platform to associate statistics like speeds and vehicle counts with roadway segments. And it has many more possible uses, beyond just traffic statistics"". A preview build is also announced."
4913,"WN364","Maps","Mapzen used the [tangram engine](https://mapzen.com/products/tangram/) to produce a futuristic-looking 3D map. Especially in large cities, the design looks like as it were from a science fiction movie. See [New York](http://tangrams.github.io/tangram-docs/?procedural/tronish.yaml#16/40.7071/-74.0075) or [Birmingham](http://tangrams.github.io/tangram-docs/?procedural/tronish.yaml#16/52.4785/-1.8970)."
4988,"WN365","Other Geo Things","Mapzen [now offers](https://mapzen.com/blog/map-matching/) map matching, which ""takes in a trajectory of latitude/longitude coordinates and returns back a route line that is snapped to the OpenStreetMap road network and enriched with attributes, like speed limits and freeway exit signs."""

6025,"WN387","Open Data","Mapzen has published their ""[Open Traffic platform](https://mapzen.com/blog/open-traffic-release/)"". It was developed in cooperation with the World Bank, and anonymized traffic data are to be made available under an open licence."
6082,"WN388","Other Geo Things","Ian Dees writes on the [Mapzen blog](https://mapzen.com/blog/all-the-places/) about a project that collects addresses for branch locations from operators' websites. The data is then converted to a more useful format (GeoJSON) and made available at [alltheplaces.xyz](http://www.alltheplaces.xyz/) under a [Creative Commons’ CC-0 waiver](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license."
6102,"WN389","Programming","Mapzen will [cease](https://mapzen.com/blog/shutdown/) operations at the end of January 2018. The migration guide [lists](https://mapzen.com/blog/migration/) all projects which will continue existing. According to a [tweet](https://twitter.com/glennon/status/945034576363102208) and the project description, the Valhalla developers are now working for Mapbox (Mapbox already has a routing engine - OSRM)."

6283,"WN393","Community","Post Mortem III: Randy Meech has written another [post](https://mapzen.com/blog/a-letter-just-to-you/) on the closing of Mapzen. It features the future of former team members and Mapzen's products."
6325,"WN394","Programming","Following on from the announcement of the shutdown of its services, Mapzen [announces](https://mapzen.com/blog/long-term-support-mapzen-maps/) how long-term support will be handled for its maps, basemap designs, and the vector and terrain tile data.  It also provides detailed instructions on how to update Mapzen-based projects with the new endpoints. The geocoding team [is currently working](https://mapzen.com/blog/v1-searching-for-the-road-ahead) on the successor to Mapzen's Pelias, [geocode.earth](geocode.earth)."

The step follows the shutdown of all of Mapzen's services, including the Metro extracts, where the GeoJSON download was an often used feature.

The collecting users will be rewarded with a blockchain currency called StreetCred token."
7768,"WN425","Other Geo Things","Randy Meech (ex CEO of Mapzen) outlines, in a long twitter thread, the philosophy behind his new business,  [Street Cred labs](https://www.streetcred.co/) , which is developing new approaches to capturing POI data. Of particular interest are [his remarks](https://twitter.com/randyme/status/1039150065074532353) about how the data may be licensed. TechCrunch has written a [short article](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/streetcred/) about the company."
8361,"WN438","Community","After Mapbox hired the Valhalla team from Mapzen, most if not all core OSRM developers seem to [have quit](https://github.com/orgs/Project-OSRM/people) their job.

8851,"WN448","Community","Stefan Keller [criticises](https://twitter.com/sfkeller/status/1095969845504552960) Mapzen and the Linux Foundation, which recently took over Mapzen's projects, for concealing the main data sources, the OpenStreetMap project, in their public announcements."
11030,"WN495","Other Geo Things","There's now a [GTFS feed](https://www.interline.io/blog/mtc-regional-gtfs-feed-release/) for the San Francisco Bay Area.  An observant reader on _Hacker News_ [noticed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22004187) that the [ACE](https://acerail.com/stations/) train (which runs [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/9599549)) is missing. The route is missing because they don't currently have geometries for the route alignment, so a suggestion was made to ""Send an intern with a logging GPS"".  It'll never work ...

Joking apart, Interline, a mobility data and service company that provides the GTFS feed, has a number of [OSM extracts](https://www.interline.io/osm/extracts/) available (they've continued where Mapzen left off), and in the Bay Area the Valley Transportation Authority has [worked closely](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/VTA_Transportation) with OSM in a number of areas, including sidewalk mapping."
11624,"WN508","Software","Mapzen, a start-up which failed early in 2018, created a lot of useful software in the OSM sphere.
