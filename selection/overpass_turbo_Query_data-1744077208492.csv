All changes can be found there.

The most obvious change, as the OSM Ops team [tweeted](https://twitter.com/OSM_Tech/status/1613681130829406209), is the representation of unpaved roads.  Unpaved roads will be rendered with a subtle stipple effect to show them as being not paved. The OSM Ops Team says: 'Unpaved roads with a suitable tag will be styled differently. Change background: [https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/pull/3399](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/pull/3399)'.

The Ops team goes on to say 'this unfortunately leaves a dilemma, many regions in OpenStreetMap unpaved is the presumed default in the absence of a `surface=` tag. But! We can fix this, let us map if roads are `surface=paved` or `surface=unpaved` (or more specific types)'.

The OSM Ops Team then turned to three organisations with a friendly appeal for help: 'Germany already has 46% of roads surfaces mapped. Zimbabwe it is only 14%. So let us get mapping road surfaces! How about it? @hotosm  @osmafrica  @youthmappers'.

Ways with no `surface` tag can easily be [found](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1q77) using overpass turbo."
