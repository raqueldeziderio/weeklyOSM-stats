According to official, but controversial information, the hurricane killed 64 people.

The researchers selected around 100 out of the 900 [barrios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrios_of_Puerto_Rico) in Puerto Rico, which are small administrative units with an average of less than 5000 inhabitants. For the sample of households, the authors randomly identified 35 buildings from the buildings on an OSM map in each of the approximately 100 barrios. The data for the selected buildings were downloaded from the Overpass API, the centroids were calculated  and converted into [Geospatial PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospatial_PDF) files. The  files along with an OSM base map were copied to the Samsung Tab A 7 tablets of the on-site interviewer.

Based on the surveyed households' data, researchers estimate that 62% or 4,645 more people died in the post-hurricane period than in the same period in the previous year. For the researchers, it is likely that the actual number is higher, as their values ​​are affected by the [survivor bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias).",3

  We [reported](https://weeklyosm.eu/archives/14381#wn556_24600) Bert -Araali- Van Opstal's complaint about some behaviour on Discord. Mateusz Konieczny, leader of the  'OSM World' moderators team on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4smYkq3gzp) (account needed) noted that the nine moderators from around the world have taken this complaint seriously. However, after hours of searching through the logs for the abusive comments described by Bert they were unable to find them. They reminded users that anyone on the discussion groups can contact the moderators directly (message @ModMail) to report abusive, racist, or insulting language. 

  Our [statement](https://weeklyosm.eu/archives/14381#wn556_24609) that there is a radio amateur on the current OSMF board is not correct. While we have learnt that one can find amateur radio operators actively contributing to the Overpass API, helping in the OSMF MWG, as founders of projects such as OpenRailwayMap, and in many other roles, we also learnt that there isn't one on the OSMF board.

20921,"WN747","Software","The [latest](https://github.com/jakecoppinger/australian-cycleway-stats/pull/8) update of Jake Coppinger's Australian Cycleway Stats project [improved](https://australiancyclewaystats.jakecoppinger.com/) the efficiency of data processing by adding features such as exclusive cycle lane detection for safer routes on low-speed roads, parallel processing for Australian and international data, and hard-coded Overpass API endpoints for different regions, improving the reliability and speed of data collection for cycleway infrastructure across Australia.",3
20963,"WN748","Programming","Overpass.jl is a Julia package that [provides](https://github.com/gwehrle/Overpass.jl) a lightweight wrapper for the Overpass API, allowing users to perform spatial queries, parse results flexibly, and customise API endpoints with minimal dependencies.",3
20934,"WN748","Releases","OsmAPP v1.6.0 has [introduced](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/zby-cz/diary/405600) major updates such as driving directions, enhanced search capabilities using the Overpass API, improved public transport and feature panels, multi-language support and innovative sharing tools, as well as a beta climbing app with features tailored for climbers, emphasising usability and open source principles.",3
21006,"WN749","OSM in action","Ubahnverleih has [investigated](https://chaos.social/@ubahnverleih/113557606398085158) :DE-s: the OpenStreetMap data used in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and concluded, after extensive flying, building height comparisons, and Overpass API queries, that the dataset likely corresponds to the planet file from 26 August 2024.",3
21243,"WN755","Programming","Minh Nguyễn [shared](https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/new-examples-of-topological-queries-in-qlever/124051) new examples of topological queries using QLever, a tool enhancing spatial analysis on OpenStreetMap data. Demonstrations include retrieving all the street intersections in Chicago, calculating compactness of city boundaries in Oklahoma, and identifying the longest straight trunk road segments in California. These examples showcase QLever's scalability, allowing analysis from urban areas to national scales, and its potential to complement Overpass API for unique queries.",3
21302,"WN756","Programming","Bert’s blog [detailed](https://bertt.wordpress.com/2025/01/10/creating-interactive-3d-hiking-map/) the creation of an interactive 3D hiking map for the Ordesa canyon in Spain using MapLibre GL JS. The project integrates terrain data from Spanish IGN, vector tiles from OpenFreeMap, and trail data from OpenStreetMap (via the Overpass API). The terrain was processed into PMTiles for efficient hosting, and the GR11 hiking trail was visualised alongside hill shading effects.",3
