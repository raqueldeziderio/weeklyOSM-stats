Sara Dean from Stamen [writes](https://hi.stamen.com/taking-open-street-map-into-the-field-a07265a08f19)  that POSM will ""make OpenStreetMap, OpenMapKit, and Field Papers, all network-centric mapping technologies, available for field deployments in extremely remote areas of the world to support the Missing Maps effort."" Read as well the comment from [Jubal Harpster](http://news.spatialdev.com/portable-open-street-map/)  from spatialdev."

As part of a local archaeological society activity in Kilkenny they [have been collecting](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/b-unicycling/diary/393061) field names using Field Papers. They have also [published](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/b-unicycling/diary/393070) a umap showing all existing places in Ireland where the names of individual fields have been added to OSM."

This supports participatory mapping approaches and risk communication using and extending OSM Field Papers. It also includes a fitness-for-purpose analysis of the OpenStreetMap data for the respective region, similar to the approach in the [ohsome Quality analysT](http://k1z.blog.uni-heidelberg.de/2021/02/08/introducing-the-ohsome-quality-analyst-oqt/) (OQT) tool."

She showcased the [Sketch Map Tool](https://sketch-map-tool.heigit.org/) (with functionality similar to [Field Papers](https://fieldpapers.org/)), that helps collect geolocated field data by tracing with pen and paper. Either OpenStreetMap (OSM) or an image is printed as the background."
