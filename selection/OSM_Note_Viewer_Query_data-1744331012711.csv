19504,"WN715","Mapping campaigns","The Austrian community has taken a collective approach in processing about 5000 map notes and about 2000 notes have already been closed in a short time. Currently, less than 3000 are still open. If you also want to help, there are a number of useful tools available:

  [An overview of all notes in Austria](https://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-notes-country?c=Austria)
  [A list of all open notes](https://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-notes-country-custom?c=Austria&query=open)
  [A list of the oldest notes per country](https://observablehq.com/@vgeorge/oldest-osm-notes-by-country)
  [A URL that displays a random note (suitable as a bookmark)](https://brzozo.ws/random-note/AT)
  The tools [NotesReview](https://ent8r.github.io/NotesReview/) and [NoteViewer](https://antonkhorev.github.io/osm-note-viewer/) for viewing local notes.
  [The JOSM plugin noteSolver for automatic assignment of changesets and notes](https://github.com/kmpoppe/noteSolver)"
