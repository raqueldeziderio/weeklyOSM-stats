21370,"WN758","Other Geo Things","Google Maps has [changed](https://developers.google.com/maps/billing-and-pricing/faq) its pricing model, which could increase the costs to developers using their APIs. Higher fees may push businesses and app developers to seek alternatives, potentially benefiting OpenStreetMap, as a free and open-source mapping solution. Companies looking to reduce expenses may migrate to other solutions including MapLibre or Leaflet, further strengthening the OSM ecosystem.",8
