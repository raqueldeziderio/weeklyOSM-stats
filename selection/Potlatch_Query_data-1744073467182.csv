As the Potlatch online editor is based on Flash, James [asks](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2017-July/078353.html) if this is the end of its life too. Potlatch enthusiasts are reassured by Richard Fairhurst that it will [continue](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2017-July/078355.html) as a desktop app for Mac/Windows running with Adobe AIR.",7

8624,"WN444","Other Geo Things","Richard Fairhurst's [New Adlestrop Railway Atlas](http://www.systemed.net/atlas/) has been appreciated by fans of old railways from around 2004 when it first appeared. However, it never covered the whole of the British Isles. Certain minor distractions in the ensuing period (including Potlatch, Potlatch2, cycle.travel, tilemaker) have limited additions. Now Richard [hints](https://twitter.com/richardf/status/1087308417709031424) at a completely new edition.",7
9730,"WN466","Mapping","Richard Fairhurst [describes](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Richard/diary/389711) the latest addition to the on-line editor Potlatch-2. Specific relations can now be assigned to a function key thus simplifying the process of adding ways to a route relation. In the comments he also provides some additional hints as to how function keys can also be used for adding groups of tags.",7
