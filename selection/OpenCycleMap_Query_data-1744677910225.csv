By contacting Andy Allan, developer of [OpenCycleMap](http://opencyclemap.org/), she found that the exact origin of the graphic is uncertain. The OpenCycleMap presents the existing OSM data in much more nuanced manner."

Particularly useful are the elevation view for route planning and the option to display public transport connections. However, it lacks built-in navigation, making it more suitable for pre-trip planning."
