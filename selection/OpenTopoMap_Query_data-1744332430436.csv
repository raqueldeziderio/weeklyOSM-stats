13835,"WN556","Maps","Amateur radio operators are keen to discover new technologies and this includes mapping. Many applications make use of OSM, such as the positional tracking service [APRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System) with its [APRS-Map](https://aprs.fi/#!mt=osm&z=11&call=&others=1&timerange=3600&tail=3600), which displays the distribution of [KiwiSDR](http://rx.linkfanel.net/) receivers, or the popular [Repeater Map](https://repeatermap.de/), which shows the position of amateur radio repeater stations. However, amateur radio operators are not just consumers of but also contributors to OSM. You can find them everywhere, writing for _weeklyOSM_, just mapping, or on the OSMF board. So it is not surprising that there are amateur radio functions in OSM community projects like the optional [QTH locator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead_Locator_System) layer, which is a special geographic co-ordinate system, on the [OpenTopoMap](https://www.opentopomap.org/#map=10/50.9548/13.0241)."
16299,"WN626","Maps","Tracestrack has [released](https://www.tracestrack.com/) an Osm-Carto/OpenTopoMap hybrid map style. With a demo page using Mapbox Globe, it shows the [OSM-Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto) style enriched with colour relief, hill shades and contour lines from [OpenTopoMap](https://github.com/der-stefan/OpenTopoMap). As a background layer, various existing label layers can be overlaid."
16704,"WN638","Software","At this year's NASA International Space Apps Challenge, a team of developers from Kyiv [presented](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/earth-data-analysis-developers-wanted/teams/worldwind-kotlin/project) an open-source SDK ([WorldWind Kotlin](https://github.com/WorldWindEarth/WorldWindKotlin)) for creating applications that work with online and offline 3D maps.

The source of data can be from any public service (OpenTopoMap, OpenStreetMap, GoogleMaps, WikiMapia and others), well-known sources of SRTM, ASTER, ALOS, GEBCO elevations, and servers working on WMS, WMTS and WCS protocols. The WorldWind Kotlin SDK supports visualisation of icons, lines, polygons and ellipses both in 3D space and on the surface. An example [application](https://tutorials.worldwind.earth/) is available to see what the end product looks like."
