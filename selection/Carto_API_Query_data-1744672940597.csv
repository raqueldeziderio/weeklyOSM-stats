276,"WN276","Maps","OSM Carto 2.36.0 was [released](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2015-October/074617.html) and has been used at OSMF's tileservers since 30. October which provide the tiles at osm.org. The new colour scheme was developed during the Google Summer of Code by Mateusz
Konieczny. One very notable change will be the new colour style of the highways. See also the [posting](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2015/10/30/openstreetmap-org-map-changing/) at OSMF blog and at the mailing lists [Talk](http://gis.19327.n5.nabble.com/Release-openstreetmap-carto-v2-36-0-tt5858363.html), [Talk-de](http://gis.19327.n5.nabble.com/Neue-Farben-im-osm-org-Kartenstil-tt5858511.html) and at the [German forum](http://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php?pid=558197#p558197). The discussion at [Talk-gb](http://gis.19327.n5.nabble.com/New-map-style-tt5858472.html) turns to the discussion if there should be a tileserver serving tiles with the old colour scheme.
