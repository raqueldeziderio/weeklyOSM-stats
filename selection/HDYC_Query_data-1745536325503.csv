A sample from the 12 cities that have started participating in the Open Cities Africa project was used.  He found out that on average 27.8% of buildings in the sample have an irregular geometry and 5.6% have overlaps or are an invalid polygon. However, there are important variations and some peaks with Pointe-Noire having over 24% of buildings with overlapping ways or invalid polygons and Victoria with more than 72% of all buildings with irregular, i.e. non-rectangular, form.

Various explanations are proposed such as the lack of good imagery for the area, dense urban areas, mapathons with inexperienced contributors and low number of local contributors."
