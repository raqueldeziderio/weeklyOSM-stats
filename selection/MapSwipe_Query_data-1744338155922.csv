2396,"WN313","Humanitarian OSM","If you want to help HOT mapping efforts by preprocessing aerial imagery while you're on the road, you can now use [Mapswipe](http://mapswipe.org/), so mappers can focus on the areas where there are actual features to map and where the imagery is useful (no clouds, sufficient resolution). You can download data beforehand and work with it while offline. The tutorial [shows](http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2016/07/18/mapswipetutorial/) some examples, so that the ""mapping"", as it is called there, too, can be carried out correctly."
