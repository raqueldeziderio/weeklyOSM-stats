New tasks are being added hourly and their progress is also [documented](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2023_Turkey_Earthquakes#Mapping_Priority) on the wiki page.

You can also [search](https://maproulette.org/browse/challenges?challengeSearch=36.49247921635242%2C36.73228144586829%2C38.44529904057117%2C37.43125118525891&location=intersectingMapBounds&query=Turkey) for MapRoulette challenges.
