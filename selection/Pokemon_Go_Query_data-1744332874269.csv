2376,"WN313","Community","As Pokémon Go is played in the real world, some were wondering about the source for the map data. Anita Lankinen [asked](http://www.spatineo.com/2016/07/mystery-pokemon-go-maps-solved-not-just-street-maps/) about it on Spatineo's blog and concludes it's definitely not OSM based.
Also in the OSM Talk mailing list, Pokémon Go and [its consequences for OSM](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2016-July/076386.html) are the subject of discussion. One thing should be obvious though: Please [don't add Pokémon spots to OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/40672133), unless you can add actually useful information about the POI itself."

That's not exactly three-quarters of the people on the planet, but it's a lot, and from a lot of different places. A puzzling load peak on Oct 1st is explained by OSM getting well-known among Pokémon Go players. Expecting further growth, he suggests a second server for the API."

The latter became somewhat famous within the OSM community as a continual source of dubious edits, because it used OSM data for background maps and game data . These edits were mainly parks; added by gamers in the hope of increasing the number of Pokémon creatures in a given area (known as the 'spawn rate')."

While this has been corrected in OSM, _Niantic_ (developer of Pokémon Go) has yet to import the data and continues to interpret it as water. Action from the developer following the Reddit thread that brought the issue to attention has given hopes for a fix (via [Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-10-11-the-island-where-you-cant-play-pokemon-go))."

With over 150 trillion parameters, the LGM aims to enable precise spatial understanding and has applications in AR, robotics, and logistics.
