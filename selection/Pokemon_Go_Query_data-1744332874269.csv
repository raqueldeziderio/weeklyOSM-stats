As reported [previously](http://www.weeklyosm.eu/archives/8125) there is some evidence Niantic may be using OSM data to decide on spawn points.

3573,"WN336","Community","It has been [speculated for a while](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/5jfnrm/how_to_find_the_new_rural_spawn_points/) that Niantic are using OSM data within Pokemon Go (to determine where certain game creatures appear).  Since just before Christmas, we've now seen a lot of Pokemon Go players updating OpenStreetMap.  In many cases their edits are to be welcomed and perfectly valid, but unfortunately a small number are adding unlikely nonexistent footpaths, parks and water features in their locality.  However what Niantic are doing is purely speculation - Grant [suggests](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2016-December/077244.html) that in the absence of hard evidence we should try and persuade US-based Pokemon Go players to perform TIGER fixup and map missing amenities :)  Using Pascal's search tool for suspicious changesets, it's easy to [find](http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-suspicious?country=-1&hours=96&mappingdays=10&tsearch=pokemon&anyobj=t&comp=%3E&value=10&action=d&obj=n#1/-9/-33) such changes.",11
