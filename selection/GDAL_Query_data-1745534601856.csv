1997,"WN305","Mapping","Adrien from French Guiana [mentions](https://twitter.com/adrienandrem/status/722483348506034179) how to take advantage of SENTINEL1 satellital images using RADAR and GDAL editing on JOSM"
8134,"WN434","Programming","A ""GDAL Coordinate System Barn Raising"" has [raised](https://gdalbarn.com) $144,000 to enable improvements to coordinate system libraries needed for the GDAL, PROJ, libgeotiff, PostGIS, and Spatialite open source toolchain.
The new libraries [provide](https://geospatial.blogs.com/geospatial/2018/10/open-source-geospatial-coordinate-sytem-libraries-are-being-revised.html) for higher accuracy transformations between coordinate systems that avoid transforming everything through WGS84 and eliminate the extra steps that this entails."
10143,"WN476","Other Geo Things","For more than 30 years WGS84 has acted as a ""pivot"" datum through which one datum can be transformed into another. Michael Giudici [explains](https://www.spatialsource.com.au/surveying/gda2020-and-overcoming-the-web-mercator-dilemma) how, in a world that demands sub-metre accuracy, the WGS84 pivot has outlived its usefulness.  The [""GDAL Coordinate System Barn Raising""](https://gdalbarn.com/) is currently working on improving GDAL, PROJ, and libgeotiff so they can handle  time-dependent coordinate reference systems and accurately transform between datums."
10865,"WN491","Maps","Hidde Wieringa [posted](https://dev.to/hiddewie/creating-a-custom-cycling-map-3g2a) a detailed guide on how to create a cycling map with open data. The toolchain involves Mapnik, PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension, Python and GDAL and makes use of OSM and SRTM elevation data. The scripts he used are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hiddewie/map-it)."
11604,"WN508","Open Data","David Morais Ferreira (osm user [dmlu](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/dmlu)) [shows](https://medium.com/@david.moraisferreira/shaded-relief-maps-using-gdal-a-beginners-guide-6a3fe56c6d) how to build shaded relief maps, using Luxembourg open data as an example."
12173,"WN520","Programming","Even Rouault, one of the main developers of the GDAL library, [pointed](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2020-July/052387.html) out in an e-mail to the mailing lists GDAL-Dev and QGIS-Developer that Spatialite, with no new release for almost five years now, will soon no longer be compatible with current versions of the Proj library. The geospatial community has to decide whether to fork Spatialite or to remove spatial analysis functions from GDAL and QGIS."
14507,"WN573","Programming","Ujaval Gandhi [announced](https://twitter.com/spatialthoughts/status/1413546411874938889) a major update to his [Mastering GDAL Tools](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/gdal-tools.html)  on SpatialThoughts (free access to course material)."
17680,"WN666","Software","Starting with version 3.7, GDAL's OpenStreetMap XML and PBF formats driver has a new [setting](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/osm.html#other-tags-field) to format 'all_tags' and 'other_tags' as JSON instead of hstore. In particular, users of ogr2ogr that redistribute OpenStreetMap can enable the feature, so that the recipients of the data do not need to depend on PostgreSQL or GDAL to parse the column."
18001,"WN676","Programming","Starting with Debian 12 'Bookworm', the [libgdal-perl package](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libgdal-perl), which is based on XS, will no longer be in the repositories. The upstream support period has ended. You can follow these [instructions](https://wiki.debian.org/BookwormGdalPerl) to migrate to the CPAN package Geo::GDAL::FFI. For more details, see the [release notes](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#noteworthy-obsolete-packages) for Debian 12."
18706,"WN697","Releases","GDAL 3.8.0 has [introduced](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/releases/tag/v3.8.0) significant speed-ups in the creation of GeoPackage files (can be 3 to 4 times faster). Instead of delegating the spatial RTree creation to SQLite, as was done before, the GDAL codebase now [embeds](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/7614) a specialised algorithm. The developer has [proposed](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/af937a36b3) the improvements in the algorithm to the SQLite project."
18810,"WN699","Programming","In his OpenStreetMap diary entry, [Sam Woodcock ](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/spwoodcock) [explained](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/spwoodcock/diary/402948) how he uses the PostGIS database to create [FlatGeobuf](http://flatgeobuf.org/) files without having to rely on the extensive [GDAL](https://gdal.org/index.html) library. He described the process, which involves the use of SQL and SQLAlchemy in FastAPI, and highlights the benefits of this method for generating FlatGeobufs, particularly in terms of efficiency and ease. This approach offers an alternative solution for data preparation and management in geospatial applications."
19522,"WN715","Mapping","[Jfd553](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/jfd553) has [documented](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/jfd553/diary/403777) his detailed mapping project on the [Magdalen Islands](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map"
19923,"WN725","Software","Tim Hirrel has [released](https://sites.google.com/tdhgis.com/tdhogr/home) TdhOGR, a GUI tool for converting various geospatial data formats, including OpenStreetMap, to another data format (based on the GDAL [library](https://gdal.org/index.html)), or to another coordinate reference system (based on the PROJ [library](https://proj.org/en/9.4/))."
21490,"WN761","Releases","The GDAL/OGR 3.10.2 bug fix version 'Gulf of Mexico' has been [released](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2025-February/060253.html) and developers are saying it is 'to be used from the darkest depths of Gulf of Mexico to the top of 
Denali'."
