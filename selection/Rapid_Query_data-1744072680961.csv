Recent changes have made more data available and the licence is now compatible with OSM.  Particularly useful is that this dataset includes a [precision threshold](https://github.com/facebook/Rapid/issues/479#issue-1272114720), which should help mappers avoid false positives (which have been a problem with the default Microsoft Buildings layer)."

Within 2 hours and 34 minutes of the incident OpenStreetMap had updated its maps to reflect the status of the bridge, demonstrating its efficiency in providing up-to-date map data, in contrast to Google Maps, which still showed the bridge but with a warning and altered routing."

20943,"WN748","Community","Christopher Beddow [explored](https://worldbuilder.substack.com/p/synchronization-of-the-editable-world) the challenges of maintaining up-to-date maps in a rapidly changing world and examined how digital tools, sensors and crowdsourced data such as OpenStreetMap aim to synchronise geospatial data with reality. While OSM provides near real-time updates, the delivery of maps often lags due to the need for error correction and cost efficiency. Advanced tools such as AI, sensors, and augmented reality promise better mapping, but the Sisyphean task of creating a perfectly dynamic map highlights the limits of technology and human effort. Ultimately, mapping validates our ever-changing world, bridging subjective experience with objective geospatial records."
