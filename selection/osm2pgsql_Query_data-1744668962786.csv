5615,"WN377","Programming","Sven Geggus [wonders](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/dev/2017-October/030010.html) if the new PostgreSQL 10.0 combined with PostGIS 2.4 brings advantages for an osm2pgsql database. The gain is less for the standard use case, but the increased parallel processing abilities will be beneficial if the database will be used for further analysis."
7572,"WN422","Maps","Christoph Hormann highlights in a [diary entry](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/imagico/diary/44711) the stricter rendering of areas that now happens following an upgrade of osm2pgsql. The changes enforce higher standards of QA for mappers, and make life for data consumers easier. Although the change is not limited to multipolygons, the most prominent objects which disappeared from the map were multipolygons. Many of these have already been fixed.
For technical details of the changes refer to the post."
7720,"WN425","Mapping","Harry Wood [re-iterates](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Harry%20Wood/diary/44900) Christoph Hormann's call to double check multipolygons. As reported osm2pgsql is repairing fewer errors than it did before it was updated. Now errors are just rejected: leading to gaps on the map."

The new version (1.0.0) drops support for old-style multipolygons and has received major functionality improvements."
11748,"WN511","Programming","Jochen Topf is [working](https://blog.jochentopf.com/2020-04-30-paying-off-technical-debt-in-osm2pgsql.html) on cleaning up the code in Osm2pgsql. This software is used to import OSM data into a PostgreSQL database. Over time it has became bloated which makes it difficult to add new features. This is very important work and he is glad he found Andy Allan, of Thunderforest, and Frederik Ramm, of Geofabrik, prepared to help fund it."

He [now continues](https://blog.jochentopf.com/2020-05-10-new-flex-output-in-osm2pgsql.html) with a blog post about his work on adding 'flex output', an output option for osm2pgsql which allows the user to specify the handling, transformation and database storage options for each OSM object."

13469,"WN548","Programming","Behind the scenes osm2pgsql is an important piece of software, replicating and manipulating OSM data for map rendering from PostgreSQL databases.

Tiles containing changed data have always been written to a list in a file, allowing selective rendering of the affected tiles.

21308,"WN756","Software","Andy Allan [tooted](https://m.gravitystorm.co.uk/@gravitystorm/113781309911289047) that the Thunderforest\.com vector tile generation servers now process OpenStreetMap data updates every 60 minutes, a significant improvement on the previous four-hour cycle. This has been achieved through upgraded hardware and updated versions of osm2pgsql, GEOS, PostgreSQL and PostGIS, increasing processing throughput by 10 times compared to 2024. These hourly updates are reflected in Thunderforest's APIs for vector sources, styles, and map tiles, increasing mapper motivation through faster map updates. While further reducing the update frequency to 10 to 20 minutes is feasible, internal caching limits the visible benefits, so hourly updates are considered sufficient for now."
