    Rory McCann [proposes](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/osmf-talk/2020-October/007300.html) that the OSMF bylaws include a provision that memberships expire, and votes become invalid if a member cannot freely exercise his or her rights or is contractually bound (e.g., with the employer) in the exercise of those rights. The opponents believe that this is practically impossible to prove. Proponents believe that the non-usability of the clause does no harm and that one must assume that companies are evil.
    Tobias Knerr [proposes](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/osmf-talk/2020-October/007302.html) a member resolution on minimum requirements for new members.

20949,"WN748","Programming","Mark Litwintschik [reviewed](https://tech.marksblogg.com/osm-mvt-vector-tiles.html) OpenStreetMap's move to hosting Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT), which allow users to customise map styles and extract data more flexibly than static raster tiles. Mark provided a step-by-step guide to visualising these tiles using tools such as QGIS and Jupyter Notebook, discussed hardware and software setups, and highlighted how vector tiles can improve the clarity and usability of mapping applications."
21332,"WN757","Other Geo Things","Wille Marcel and Lane Goodman have shared some insights on visualising NASA's polar geospatial data using 3D mapping libraries such as deck\.gl, MapLibre, and Mapbox Globe View. Their blog [highlighted](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2024-12-19-casei-globe/) challenges with the Mercator projection near the poles and the process of refining tools for the CASEI platform to enable accurate data representation across polar regions. Open source solutions and experiments with Globe View visualisation were detailed to improve geospatial workflows."
