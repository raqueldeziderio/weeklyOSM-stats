[The OpenRouteService Disaster Map](http://openls.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/disaster/) and the routing graph will be updated regularly.

Most importantly, the additional OpenRouteService SOS - route profile currently considers passable and impassable tagged ways and dynamically adjusts the graph weights of OSM streets accordingly.

ORS also provides an Accessibility Analysis Service for a given location, the possibility to export GPS tracks to be used offline on mobile device and the interactive Avoid Feature Area Tool (in case areas are severely effected by debris and not accessible at all). These features are thus potentially valuable for Search and Rescue (SAR) units.",11
