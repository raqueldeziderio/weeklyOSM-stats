8122,"WN433","Community","Opencagedata.com [features](https://blog.opencagedata.com/post/openinframap-interview) an interview with Russ Garrett of [OpenInfraMap.org](https://openinframap.org). Russ, who met Steve Coast in a pub back in 2005, leads the project OpenInfraMap, which is an OSM-based visualisation of infrastructure, most prominently power networks but also telecommunications, petroleum, and water infrastructure."
9189,"WN455","Maps","Russ Garrett made [some enhancements](https://twitter.com/russss/status/1113363241239969793) to [OpenInfraMap](https://openinframap.org/#2/26/12): different aspects of infrastructure are now shown as layers, and a heat map layer of solar photovoltaic generators has been added."
11177,"WN499","Maps","[Russ Garret](https://russ.garrett.co.uk/), the creator and maintainer of [OpenInfraMap](https://www.openinframap.org), announced [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/openinframap/status/1225577562732142592) that OpenInfraMap now links power infrastructure to Wikipedia and uses images from Wikidata where available. Links have also been added to the UK's Renewable Energy Planning Database."
11784,"WN512","Open Data","Researchers from the University of Southampton have [created](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0469-8) the first global, open-access, harmonised spatial datasets of wind and solar installations. The data are based on power infrastructure objects in OpenStreetMap. They analysed global distribution and estimated output through a combination of techniques including other third-party external data. The datasets are available in a range of formats: geopackages, shapefiles, or comma-delimited text. Last but not least their data pipeline is documented and can be re-run anytime. It is worth checking in [OpenInfraMap](https://www.openinframap.org) whether the power infrastructure around your area is mapped correctly."
13452,"WN548","Mapping","OpenInfraMap [added](https://twitter.com/openinframap/status/1349701728023826434) a [statistics section](https://openinframap.org/stats), showing data about the power network by country. For OSM contributors, this is especially useful to identify mis-tagged power plants."

The water layer has also been [updated](https://en.osm.town/@OpenInfraMap/113274678357024586) to display reservoirs, water treatment and sewerage plants, and pumping stations."
