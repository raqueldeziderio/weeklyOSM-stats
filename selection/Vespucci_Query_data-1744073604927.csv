635,"WN281","Software","Simon Poole has created wheelchair [presets](https://simonpoole.github.io/wheelchair-preset/) for JOSM and Vespucci."
1014,"WN288","Mapping","[Simon Poole](http://hdyc.neis-one.org/?SimonPoole) tells about, what is in the pipeline for the [next Vespucci](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/SimonPoole/diary/37802) release."
1370,"WN294","Mapping","Users Warin [has made](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2016-March/028782.html) a [proposal](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/Sells) to tag the product ranges of POIs on the tagging mailing list, but this has been criticised on several points. The developers of [iD](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2016-March/028796.html) and [Vespucci](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2016-March/028795.html) are bothered by the use of an unlimited number of keys. Frederik Ramm [speculates about](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2016-March/028812.html) importing a supermarket's entire product list (and the dangers of inviting this). He points out that OSM is not a business directory and is not the right place to map [ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science))."
2414,"WN314","Software","A new version of Vespucci just [arrived](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/SimonPoole/diary/39012). However, due to problems with Google/Android, this version is only available via Github and not via Google's play store."

Google [removed](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/2909) StreetComplete from the Play Store last week. Google claimed that the app was not compliant with its policy for the background location permission, a permission it apparently does not even request! Tobias Zwick contacted Google support about the mistake immediately, but after more than a week, he was still waiting for a reply. Vespucci developer Simon Poole commented [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/openstreetmap/comments/nl7x5m/is_street_complete_gone_from_the_playstore/) that he had also experienced a similar Kafkaesque situation with Google Play in November. With some sage advice from Simon the StreetComplete developers have managed to create a [version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.westnordost.streetcomplete) that Google Play deems acceptable.
