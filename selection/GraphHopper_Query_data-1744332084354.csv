Now it will take into account speed limits for different countries, even if there is no explicit `maxspeed` tag in OpenStreetMap. Kazakh and Uzbek translations have been added. Data structures have also been adapted to increase the speed of importing OSM data, which is constantly growing."
19300,"WN710","Software","Peter [explained](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2024/02/27/osmand-with-graphhopper-navigation/) how to use GraphHopper to calculate navigation routes in the OSMAnd app."
19648,"WN718","OSM in action","Jacek Gęborys has [created](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1c8nns5/rail_transit_availability_within_walking_distance/) several maps visualising the accessibility of railway stations in various major cities. He [used](https://en.osm.town/@karussell@chaos.social/112303960971144517) QGIS with OpenStreetMap as a source for the stops, in particular with the Overpass API, which allows you to automate the fetching of data and GraphHopper for calculating isochrones."
19665,"WN718","Releases","GraphHopper version 9.0 has been [released](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2024/04/23/graphhopper-routing-engine-9-0-released/). It comes with an improved GPX export, updated translations, many bug fixes, more route hints, and conditional access information."
20159,"WN730","Releases","GraphHopper has [introduced](https://chaos.social/@karussell/112734598199995625) a user-friendly update to its mapping service, 'Route Planning Step-by-Step', which allows walkers and cyclists to easily create and modify routes by right-clicking or long-pressing on the map to set start and end points and add additional locations. This update [improved](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2024/07/05/route-planning-step-by-step/) route customisation directly on desktop and mobile devices, making the planning process more intuitive and flexible."
20830,"WN746","Releases","Peter [announced](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2024/11/05/graphhopper-routing-engine-10-0-released/) the release of GraphHopper Routing Engine version 10.0. This release fixed a long-standing issue with u-turn routing, added several improvements to turn restriction implementations, and included an enhanced version of GraphHopper Maps with text search functionality."
21312,"WN756","Programming","Swiggy Bytes’s two-part blog series explored leveraging OpenStreetMap data for hyperlocal delivery routing by evaluating road quality and using machine learning to detect and fix issues. [Part 1](https://bytes.swiggy.com/the-osm-distance-service-part-1-evaluation-metrics-and-routing-configurations-6e8686ca814f) introduced the OSM-APLS and delta-coverage metrics to evaluate OSM's road accuracy. By analysing delivery trips, they identified routing configurations, concluding that the 'motorcycle short-fastest' mode was optimal for accurate distance calculations using GraphHopper. [Part 2](https://bytes.swiggy.com/the-osm-distance-service-part-2-fixing-roads-90bd6d3bb60f) presented a machine learning pipeline to detect missing roads, connectivity issues, and incorrect travel directions in OSM. Using unsupervised and self-supervised approaches, the system flagged and fixed errors, improving coverage and accuracy of road networks."
