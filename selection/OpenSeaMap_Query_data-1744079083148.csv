19220,"WN707","Did you know that…","... [this](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1211591064) could be the node with the most tags in OSM? The tagging models the entirety of the lighthouse's [light characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_characteristic). But for something that appears this interesting on [OpenSeaMap](https://map.openseamap.org/?zoom=16.2&lon=5.83533&lat=62.42695&layers=TFTFFFTFFTFFFFFFFFFFFF), [real-life](http://www.flickr.com/photos/84096928@N00/5116143568/) is a bit of a let down. 

For those who are curious about what the complex notation in OpenSeaMap means, `Oc(2)G.8s` for example represents an [occulting green light](https://en.osm.town/@rtnf/111896260697130521), where a pair of brief dark intervals repeats every eight seconds."
