13138,"WN541","Software","OpenStreetCam is now [KartaView](https://blog.improveosm.org/en/2020/11/hello-kartaview/). The name change happened after the OSM Foundation (OSMF) adopted a Trademark Policy discouraging names like OpenStreet-Thing. To support this, the team decided to change the name to KartaView."
13798,"WN555","Releases","Following OpenStreetCam's transition to KartaView at the end of last year, KartaView has [announced](https://blog.improveosm.org/en/2021/03/openstreetcam-plugin-becomes-kartaview-and-integrates-new-visualisation-feature/) many further innovations."
14335,"WN569","Community","KartaView, previously known as [OpenStreetCam](https://blog.improveosm.org/en/hello-kartaview/), recently shared a post on [how to get started with KartaView](https://blog.improveosm.org/?p=1742). If you are new and want to try something interesting, why don't you give this a try?"

    Martijn van Exel [talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXYnN5U1dn8) about MapRoulette
    Philipp Kandal and Alex Ilisei [explaining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK7XWljqJdI) that [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/grab-interactive-travel-map/) uses OSM and how they generate images for [Kartaview](https://kartaview.org/landing) (formerly OpenStreetCam and OpenStreetView) to contribute to OSM.
    Steve Coast explaining the [MapMetrics](https://mapmetrics-world.innovation.tomtom-global.com/#?mapSource=DARK&metric=median_count&z=5&lat=48.472350&lon=14.458008&ds=OSM202104&ds2=None&mapSource2=OSM) tool that TomTom introduced in 2021. He also [demonstrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh5fV8TVlSo) how to work with it. Furthermore he gave an outlook on 'automatic road alignment'."
16413,"WN630","Did you know that…","... if you are using the Greasemonkey Addon for the Firefox browser, there's a powerful script that gives you multiple ease-of-use changes for openstreetmap.org? You will have direct access to Mapillary and KartaView links that point to the same map area and multiple tools from a sidebar such as OSMCha (for Changesets), OSM Deep History, and Nominatim (for other Objects), or a link to create an overpass history request when you’re looking at a note. Also, when you’re viewing your 'My Notes' page, you will have the option to filter only unresolved notes for a better overview. You can see the development process on [GitHub](https://github.com/OSM-de/osm-org-greasemonkey), or you can [install the script](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/OSM-de/osm-org-greasemonkey@master/osm-org-greasemonkey.user.js) directly into Greasemonkey."

Some of them, such as [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/), [KartaView](https://kartaview.org/) and [Mapilio](https://mapilio.com/), allow the use of the images for OSM mapping."

Paul [explained](https://t.me/OSM_de/110149) :DE-s: Panoramax in a nutshell: 'Street pictures à la Kartaview/Mapillary, but technically like Mastodon'.
