Google [removed](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/2909) StreetComplete from the Play Store last week. Google claimed that the app was not compliant with its policy for the background location permission, a permission it apparently does not even request! Tobias Zwick contacted Google support about the mistake immediately, but after more than a week, he was still waiting for a reply. Vespucci developer Simon Poole commented [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/openstreetmap/comments/nl7x5m/is_street_complete_gone_from_the_playstore/) that he had also experienced a similar Kafkaesque situation with Google Play in November. With some sage advice from Simon the StreetComplete developers have managed to create a [version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.westnordost.streetcomplete) that Google Play deems acceptable. If the issue reoccurs the app can always be downloaded from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.westnordost.streetcomplete/) and directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/releases)."

21108,"WN752","OpenStreetMap Foundation","^[1]^ On Sunday 15 December OpenStreetMap and related services went [offline](https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/openstreetmap-org-currently-offline-operations-team-are-working-to-restore-15-december-2024/122930/20) at approximately 04:00 UTC due to a router hardware failure affecting Internet Service Provider (ISP) servers in Amsterdam. The OSM Operations Team (one permanent and volunteers) reported on the OSM Community forum about the progress to get back online.
  The ISP had confirmed the issue and was waiting for a replacement router shipped from California to the Amsterdam site.
  OSM's infrastructure includes a primary database in Amsterdam and follower databases in Dublin, synchronised through asynchronous replication. The uplink failure in Amsterdam led to a minor amount of map data being unsynced with Dublin. To avoid data loss, the Dublin database was not promoted to the primary role. Manual synchronisation over a 4G VPN was also deemed too risky, so as a precaution, OSM was placed in read-only mode to maintain data integrity.
  In the meantime, the OSM operations were successful in moving to a new ISP for deployment in Amsterdam and Dublin, while awaiting the expedited delivery and installation of the replacement router.
  On Tuesday 17 December, around 13:24:48 UTC, all services were back up and [running](https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/openstreetmap-org-currently-offline-operations-team-are-working-to-restore-15-december-2024-updated/122930/81) again.
